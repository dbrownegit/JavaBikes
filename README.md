Dublin Bikes API Java
The purpose of this project was to perform a web scrape of the Dublin Bikes API using Java to insert the data into a SQLite Database for the pupose of analysis. Although it ran successfully locally I had some issues getting it to work on my site so future plans to improve the code which is fairly basic have been postponed.
